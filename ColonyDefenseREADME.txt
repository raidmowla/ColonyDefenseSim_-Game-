About the game:

In this adventure, you have to find a series of items, fight enemies and repair defenses to fend off a final wave of enemies. 

Below is the opening text of the game:

Welcome to Colony Defense Sim!
You are the sole survivor of a rimworld colony built into a mountain. Raiders attacked your fledgling homestead and killed the other colonists, your friends and family.

After burying the dead, you survey the colony. The only way into the colony is through the south wall and its crumbling in portions. 

You see that the main power to the base is offline, leaving the autoturrets offline and the main gate unlocked. 

You'll have to search your base for whatever supplies are left. The colony was running low on supplies before the raider attack. The attack has left the base mostly barren. 

You might find some items leftover, however. You'll need to find ammo, weapons and building supplies to fix the south walls.  

Each room will tell you which directions you can go. Be careful because you heard some crashes and rustling in the colony as you buried the bodies. 

Complete the game by defeating the raiders and repairing your base. You can move north, south, east or west by typing n,s,e or w. 

Type q to end the program.
